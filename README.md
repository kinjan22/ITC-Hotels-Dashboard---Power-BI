* Identify revenue distribution across different room categories and properties.
* Track revenue growth trends (MoM and WoW) to assess financial performance.
2. Occupancy & Capacity Analysis:
* Analyze occupancy rates for weekdays vs. weekends.
* Compare performance of different room categories (Elite, Premium, Standard, etc.).
* Correlate occupancy rates with revenue generation (RevPAR).
3. Booking Insights & Trends:
* Understand booking lead time and average length of stay.
* Identify seasonal revenue fluctuations and room categories contributing the most revenue.
* Compare revenue trends for different cities and properties.
4. Cancellation Analysis:
* Measure cancellation rates and their impact on revenue.
* Identify categories with the highest cancellation rates and reasons behind them.
* Compare weekday vs. weekend cancellations to identify patterns.
  
## Techniques Used:
* Data Aggregation & Analysis: Summarizing financial metrics, occupancy rates, and booking patterns.
* Trend Analysis: Monitoring revenue, occupancy, and cancellation trends over time.
* Comparative Analysis: Comparing room category performance and revenue trends across properties.
* Correlation Analysis: Assessing the relationship between occupancy rates and revenue generation.
* Predictive Analytics: Using insights to recommend strategies for revenue optimization and reducing cancellations.
  
## Tools Used:
* Power BI: Data visualization, interactive dashboard creation, and comparative analysis.
  
## Conclusion:
The analysis provided valuable insights into ITC Hotels' revenue generation, occupancy trends, and booking behaviours. By applying advanced techniques in Power BI, the findings help identify areas of improvement for revenue optimization, enhancing room utilization, and minimizing revenue loss due to cancellations.
